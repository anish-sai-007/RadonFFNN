Feedforward Neural Network model to analyze radon levels and identify potential earthquake precursors.

The dataset used in this project is confidential and cannot be shared publicly due to organizational and privacy constraints.

If you're interested in replicating this project, we recommend using a similar time-series dataset related to radon concentration or geophysical measurements. You can structure your data to match the input format used in the notebook.
